background: This goes back to my high school days. I love car mechanisms and welding/fabrication, so in my spare time, I wanted to build a Go Kart! Thankfully, my welding teacher, donated an old lawn mower that I used to convert into an awesome go kart! Many of my welding friends helped out on building the go kart and I had a lot of fun designing this from scratch and not spending a penny!
description: The go kart’s design was heavily influenced by the fact that it needed to use an old lawn mower’s parts. One of the biggest problems was that the engine was a vertical gasoline engine. Which meant that our swing rear solid axle suspension system was not able to work mechanically with the engine, without other additional power transferring mechanisms. Now, keep in mind that the point was to convert the lawn mower into a go kart, so the parts that we could use were limited. After some thought, I decided to mount the entire engine on the rear axle transmission and move the driver seat as forward as possible to still have weight on the front tires. The go kart had an independent single A-arm suspension on the front and a solid axle swing suspension system on the rear. This project was one of my favorites, but because I had to move to Waterloo Ontario for University, I gave it away to a friend of mine that hopefully has improved the design and has fun driving it!
