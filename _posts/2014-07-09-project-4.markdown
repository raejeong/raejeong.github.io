background: Around the time that I learnt more about robotics and controls, there were big push forward in solving robotics controls problem with learning methods. These methods also gave hope for abstract and complex tasks such as robot manipulation in unknown environments. I knew that this was what I wanted to learn so I decided to read the Deep Learning Book, the Reinforcement Learning: Introduction as well as the CS231n Deep Learning course from Stanford.
