background: After making the four DOF robotic arm, I realized that the biggest obstacle to creating an affordable and capable robotic arm of the future relies on the gear reducer used for the robotic arm and the manipulation software. This motivated me to explore the alternatives to the widely popular but expensive and inefficient, harmonics drives.
