background: Currently, as part of my undergraduate capstone project I am working on an autonomous indoor blimp robot with a team of five others. Compared to other autonomous platforms, the blimp provided excellent maneuverability and safety for indoor environments due to its low inertia and inherent stability. Our main goal for the project is to build a light-weight blimp and implement a local collision avoidance algorithm, and later combine it with a global planner. One of the main challenges with this project is the significant weight limitations placed on the payload of the blimp. In the design, the sensor payload is limited to a camera along with sonar sensors. Several possible solutions were explored,including traditional methods involving mapping and object detection, as well as solutions like end-to-end learning for collision avoidance.
description: Given the run-time constraints and the desire for functionality in new environments with minimal labeling, the first proposed solution was eliminated. On the other hand, the end-to-end learning approach allows for automatically labeled training data based on inputs at the time of collection, along with more expressive and generalized features. An interesting aspect of the project is the use of simulated data to first pre-train the network to reduce the need of real data. Given the nature of the problem, the DAGGER algorithm works well to alleviate distribution mismatches and helps to improve the learned policy. In the future I also plan to implement deep reinforcement learning methods to tackle the problem: namely investigating Q-learning with data augmentation methods similar to CAD2RL to minimize data collection time and use simulated data. The Cognitive Mapping and Planning for Visual Navigation is also a work that we wish to re-implement for navigation.
