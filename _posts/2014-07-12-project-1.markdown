background: Currently, as part of my undergraduate capstone project I am working on an autonomous indoor blimp robot with a team of five others. Compared to other autonomous platforms, the blimp provided excellent maneuverability and safety for indoor environments due to its low inertia and inherent stability. Our main goal for the project is to build a light-weight blimp and implement a local collision avoidance algorithm, and later combine it with a global planner.
description: In this project, I implemented different types of Deep RL algorithms for the awesome Roboschool environment from OpenAI. I also tried out a new algorithm called Advantage Actor-Suggester, which was my attempt at combining deep Q-learning and advantage actor-critic methods, for which you can find the paper in this link.
