background: This was my main project at Wilco Machine and Mold. Our client needed a way to control and monitor the temperature of 3 units and the heat should decrease at night to save energy. 
description: The goals for this project was program a PLC that gathers temperature data from the boiler and the outside of each units to control the three valves for each room and the boiler valve. The user should be able to set the temperature of each unit and also be able to set the value of the drop in temperature at night. The controls were kept simple by monitoring the temperature with time de-bouncing to decide when to turn on and off the relays that were controlling the valves. From the user interface, you can change all the variables to get the optimal setting you want. The outside temperature data was used to automatically adjust the boiler temperature change rate, according to the weather outside. This let us decrease the over and undershoot in the boiler temperature and thus decrease the over and undershoot of individual apartment. This was a great project that taught me PLC programming, electrical wiring, user experience and a little bit of controls algorithm and the real life problems that comes with it.
