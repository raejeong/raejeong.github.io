background: This was one of the big projects that I worked on at MakeLab. OLG wanted an activation trailer that has three physical video games for the PanAm Games. The trailer traveled all over Ontario for 2 months and thousands of people experienced the game.
description: MakeLab was in charge of creating three video game controllers. The three games were Relay, Kayak, and a Hand Cycle. I started halfway through the project timeline, so I was mainly working on the sensor embedding to the physical parts and interfacing with a PC to send keyboard commands. We used various sensors such as pressure pads, Piezo sensors, reed switches and gyroscopes to make custom game controllers. Individual game controllers were connected to data acquisition boards (Arduino based boards) and sent keyboard presses to the PC as a HID device. It was a fun project and the main challenges were to create a unique solution that is intuitive and extremely durable. I never worked on a piece of publicly used technology before and I learnt a lot about engineering design choices on how to make things durable, because if there are (roughly) 5000 random people using this for a game and they are excited, I guarantee you that they will try to break it!
