category: Complete
background: This was one of the big projects that I worked on at MakeLab. OLG wanted an activation trailer that has three physical video games for the PanAm Games. The trailer traveled all over Ontario for 2 months and thousands of people experienced the game.
description: MakeLab was in charge of creating three video game controller. Three games were Relay, Kayak, and a Hand Cycle. I came in the project half way, so I was mainly working on the sensor embedding to the physical parts and interfacing with a PC to send keyboard commands. We used varies sensors such as pressure pads, Piezo sensors, reed switches and gyroscope to make a custom game controllers. Individual game controllers were connected to data acquisition board (Arduino based boards) and sent keyboard presses to the PC as a HID device. It was a fun project and the main challenges were to create a unique solution to be intuitive and extremely durable. I never worked on a publicly used technology piece and I learnt a lot about engineering design choices on how to make things durable, because if there are (roughly) 5000 random people using this for a game and they are excited, I guarantee you that they will try to break it!
