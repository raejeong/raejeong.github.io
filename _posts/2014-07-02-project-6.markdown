background: This goes back to my high school days, where I first got into robotics. This was a robotics competition that I competed for two years with my team Leduc Composite High School. I want to give a shout out to the awesome team that I had the pleasure to lead, Josh Mulder, Kurk Urvold and Timurlane Çakmak. Also I can’t forget about our amazing advisors and teachers who went out of their way to help us out, Dennis Cebuliak, Greg Loose, Brad Gilmour and all of friends. Lastly, I want to thank them personally, because this experience influenced my future greatly.
description: Diving into the project itself, the first year we competed, we got bronze in Alberta. The challenge was to put wooden cubes in the circular box that is on wheels. One of the big challenges were that the robot we wanted was much bigger than the size restriction, so we made the robot be able to transform by folding the robot in half at the start of the challenge. The second competition, was to put low profile wooden boxes in a closet, and this time we went to nationals and received 4th in Canada. One of the big issues with this one was that the arm was too heavy for the linear actuator to lift it and we were again, so close to the size limitation, we need a solution that was cheap and compact. Eventually, we found the solution to be a car hood spring piston that we used to counter balance the arm. I won’t get into too much detail here (if you want to know more, feel free to contact me! I love nothing more than talking about robots!). Overall, this experience was a life changing experience that shaped my future. My high school never had robotics competitions and I remember one day Dennis Cebuliak (my computer science teacher) coming to be asking if I was interested, and even though there were lots of hurdles, it was one of the best thing that happened in my life!
