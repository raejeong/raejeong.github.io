background: I knew of the existence of 3D printing technology for a while now but only in the beginning of 2015 did I really start to take a deeper look into the technology and its future. I quickly fell in love with the possibilities of the 3D printing technology and the affordability of the fused deposition modelling technology. I had many friends who were building their own versions of 3D printers and I thought, I should make one myself! It was a great chance to do some exciting mechanical design and also get a 3D printer at the end! My goals are to use a maximum of $500 CAD, a Cartesian system design and a relatively big build volume (~ 200 mm x 200 mm x200 mm).
description: First, I took a look at what was out there. There are many 3D printer designs, but only few of them caught my eyes (many of them are very similar). Four 3D printer designs that caught my eyes were the Delta, the Direct Extruder with X gantry on Y gantry (MakerBot Replicator 2), the Bowden Cartesian setup (Ultimaker) and the H-bot design. I wanted an elegant design that I would have fun designing. As a result of some issues like the ripple effect (ripples in the final print, due to the heavy gantry moving) I eliminated the MakerBot Replicator 2 design. The delta seemed like a great choice but there has been many DIY delta printers and most of my friends were choosing this design. Since I plan on releasing the documentations, CAD and a little tutorial, I decided to eliminate the delta design and do something different - one can argue on which is the superior designs, but in my opinion, they are all elegant and functional. Also, I wanted to do something different, new and exciting for myself, and I was confident that execution and implementation is what will make this special. Lastly, it was between the H-bot and the Ultimaker design. I knew there were many lovers of the Ultimaker and their design excited me more than the H-bot, so I decided on the Ultimaker design for the gantry setup. For a bigger volume, I did not want to use the cantilever bed design that are on the MakerBot Replicator 2 and the Ultimaker, so I decided to do a two point lead screw bed design. This is a project that I want to focus on the mechanical engineering aspect and let other people use this project with ease, so I decided on the popular and cheap Ramps 1.4 board and NEMA17 stepper motors. My printer uses the Marlin open source software for reliability (compared to writing my own controls) and ease of use and modifications. It is important to use parts that are easy to make. So all the parts are laser cut, off the shelf or 3D printed (3D printer building 3D printers!). Like I mentioned above, when I finish the project, I plan on releasing the source and have a little tutorial!
