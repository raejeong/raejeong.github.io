                    <h4 class="service-heading">Mechanical</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Mechanical Engineering is the part of Mechatronics Engineering that I am most experienced with. I love beautiful mechanical design and often I love to just think about the different mechanical problems as if it is a riddle or a puzzle. One of the most interesting designs for me are the gearboxes. I designed a CVT of my own version in high school and recently, I am fascinated by the harmonic drives and cycloidal drives for robotic applications. In my portfolio, many of the projects heavily involved solid mechanical design and as I learn more about robotics, I cannot wait to design beautiful robotic mechanisms. Lastly, one of the most amazing designs that I have come across is the load balancing system on the PR2 (Willow Garage) manipulator (The robot on the top of my website). If anyone wants to have a discussion about the PR2 design and teach me a thing or two, I am all yours!</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Software</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">My software development style comes heavily from my time at Polar in 2013. During my time at Polar, I learnt about correct practices in programming. This is the time that I used versioning systems like Github to work in a team of roughly 15 software engineers. I learnt a lot about development cycles and how to tackle problems, bugs or features. Because of my interest in robotics, I continued to play around with microcontrollers like Arduino and framework called ROS. Learning about ROS was very exciting because it was connecting the lower level hardware to the massive and awesome features and libraries of ROS to do very complicated challenges! The ROS tutorials on the ROS Wiki was great but it was a little dull when I was first starting out with ROS. After finishing the ROS tutorials, I found really awesome set of tutorials on Clearpath’s support website. So for anyone that wants to play around with ROS, I highly recommend ROS tutorials from Clearpath (Thanks Martin Cote!) and to use Arduino with ROS, the rosserial tutorials on the ROS wiki are amazing (Few typos and errors corrected in my GitHub for rosserial)! I have an awesome Robotic Arm Project (RAP) that I am working with a friend of mine (Swapnil Patel) that will use ROS in a very exciting way!</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">My electrical engineering background comes from varies projects, work experiences and university courses. I love to play around with Arduino and raspberry pi to create fun little projects using varies sensors and actuators! I am also quite interested in motor controllers and how they work. One of my small projects was to create an H-Bridge using MOSFETs and Arduino to control a powerful motor. After couple failed prototyping boards and smoking MOSFETs, I was able to drive the motor and it was awesome! At my time at Wilco Machine and Mold, I was in charge of a project that used a PLC (Unitronics v-130) to control a residential unit’s temperature. We used PT100s and simple relay valves to control and monitor the temperature for three units. I was in charge of the whole project from start to finish, so I learnt decent amount of electrical circuitry with this project! I find electrical engineering fascinating and powerful and I can’t wait to learn more through projects, work experience and university courses!</p>
