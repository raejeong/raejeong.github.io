                    <p class="text-muted" align="left">Mechanical Engineering is the aspect of Mechatronics Engineering that I am most experienced with. I love beautiful mechanical designs and often love to just think about different mechanical problems as if they were a riddle or a puzzle. Gearboxes are some of the most interesting designs to me. I designed my own version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission"> CVT </a> in high school and recently, I have been fascinated by the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_drive"> Harmonic Drive </a>and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloidal_drive"> Cyclodial Drive </a>for robotics applications. In my portfolio, many of the projects heavily involved solid mechanical designs and the more I learn about robotics, the more I cannot wait to design beautiful robotic mechanisms. Lastly, one of the most amazing designs that I have come across is the load balancing system on the<a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview"> PR2 </a>(<a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/">Willow Garage</a>) manipulator (pictured at the top of my website). If anyone wants to have a discussion about the PR2 design and teach me a thing or two, I am all yours!</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Software</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted" align="left">My software development style comes heavily from my time at<a href="http://polar.me/#welcome"> Polar </a>in 2013. During my time at Polar, I learnt about correct practices in programming. This is the time that I used versioning systems like<a href="https://github.com/raejeong"> GitHub </a>to work in a team of roughly 15 software engineers. I learnt a lot about development cycles and how to tackle problems, bugs or features. Because of my interest in robotics, I continued to play around with microcontrollers like<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"> Arduino </a>and framework called<a href="http://www.ros.org/"> ROS</a>. Learning about ROS was very exciting because it was connecting the lower level hardware to the massive and awesome features and libraries of ROS to do very complicated challenges! The<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials"> ROS tutorials </a>on the ROS Wiki was great but it was a little dull when I was first starting out with ROS. After finishing the ROS tutorials, I found really awesome set of tutorials on<a href="https://support.clearpathrobotics.com/hc/en-us/categories/200165835-ROS"> Clearpath Robotics’s support website</a>. So for anyone that wants to play around with ROS, I highly recommend ROS tutorials from<a href="http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/"> Clearpath Robotics </a>(Thanks Martin Cote!) and to use Arduino with ROS, the<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials"> rosserial Arduino tutorials </a>on the ROS wiki are amazing (Few typos and errors corrected in my GitHub for rosserial)! I have an awesome<a href="http://raejeong.com/#portfolio"> Robotic Arm Project (RAP) </a>that I am working with a friend of mine (Swapnil Patel) that will use ROS in a very exciting way!</p>

                    <p class="text-muted" align="left">My electrical engineering background comes from varies projects, work experiences and university courses. I love to play around with Arduino and<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"> Raspberry Pi </a>to create fun little projects using varies sensors and actuators! I am also quite interested in motor controllers and how they work. One of my small projects was to create an H-Bridge using MOSFETs and Arduino to control a powerful motor. After couple failed prototyping boards and smoking MOSFETs, I was able to drive the motor and it was awesome! At my time at<a href="https://www.wilcomachine.ca/"> Wilco Machine and Mold</a>, I was in charge of a<a href="http://raejeong.com/#portfolio"> Residential Temperture Control System </a>that used a PLC (Unitronics v-130) to control a residential unit’s temperature. We used PT100s and simple relay valves to control and monitor the temperature for three units. I was in charge of the whole project from start to finish, so I learnt decent amount of electrical circuitry with this project! I find electrical engineering fascinating and powerful and I can’t wait to learn more through projects, work experience and university courses!</p>
