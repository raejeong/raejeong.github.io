                                    <p class="text-muted">At MakeLab I was leading the research and development of a lightweight robotic arm. The goal was to create an affordable robotic arm for the company. The challenge was to have a 4 DOF robotic arm, lift 1 kg payload at 1 meter range. I decided on using ROS as the platform and each joint is equipped with an Arduino to run the embedded PID controller. The robotic arm is modular and uses PVC piping as its structure. I have currently took over the project, outside of MakeLab to bring this project to the world as an open source project. MakeLab is a great sponsor and a client to me now, and I really loved working with every and each one of my co-workers!</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">At Wilco Machine and Mold, I was responsible for PLC programming and high precision part machining. Before Wilco Machine and Mold, I had a lot of machining and fabrication experience but I have never worked with CNC mill or CNC lathe. Since we had a whole shop with all the tools you can imagine, we designed and manufactured the parts we needed for food packaging machine. This experience has taught me to design parts with ease of machining and the parts that I designed in Solidworks was imported in to BobCAM and we were machining parts on the CNC mills and lathe, in a very short amount of time. Another part of my job was to program PLCs for food packaging machines and a Residential Temperature Control System. We retrofitted many food packaging machines and most of the work was redoing all the electronics, including the PLC programming. The Residential Temperature Control System was for our client who wanted to control and monitor the temperature for three units. I was in charge of this project, from start to installation.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">Polar was my first Co-Op experience and I really enjoyed the wonderful startup energy there. I was a software engineer Co-Op, so most of my time there consisted of bug fixes and feature implementations. We used Python as the main language and I got lots of great experience in proper software development and working in a sizable software engineering team. Polar was a start-up with a great structure and whenever I work on the software part of a project, I look back to the practices that was implemented in Polar to do the development efficiently and properly!</p>
