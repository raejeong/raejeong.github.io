                                    <p class="text-muted">Starting in January of 2016, I have started as a mechanical engineering intern at Fetch Robotics. Fetch Robotics builds robot systems for the logistics industry. The Fetch Robotics system is comprised of a mobile base (called Freight) and an advanced mobile manipulator (called Fetch). Fetch and Freight can also use a charging dock for autonomous, continuous operations; allowing the robots to charge when needed and continue on with their tasks. During my internship at Fetch Robotics, I have learnt a good deal of mechanical design. The project that I was working on required me to exercise my knowledge in mechanism design. The design required three degree of actuation mechanism for robotic application. I cannot talk about the project in depth, but what I can say is that being around amazing roboticists with a lot of experience and knowledge was an incredibly valuable experience.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">Starting in September of 2015, I have taken on the undergraduate research assistant position at the Waterloo Autonomous Vehicles Lab. The Waterloo Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory is led by Prof. Steven Waslander and is focused on outdoor autonomy for aerial and ground vehicles.  With core projects on quadrotor flight control in the presence of winds, visual SLAM, scan registration and autonomous driving, the WAVELab seeks to advance robot perception, planning, control and coordination for new applications. I am currently working on the gimbal implementation and testing for the drone research. I had the chance to design and build an apparatus to test the repeatability of the Pan-Tilt Unit-D46-17 and to write the necessary ROS nodes for the experiment. Recently I have been working on designing the calibration apparatus and writing ROS drivers and nodes for gimbals to be used for SLAM using Multi-Camera cluster.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">At MakeLab I was leading the research and development of a lightweight robotic arm. The goal was to create an affordable robotic arm for the company. The challenge was to have a 4 DOF robotic arm, which can lift a 1 kg load at 1 meter range. I decided on using ROS as the platform and each joint is equipped with an Arduino to run the embedded PID controller. The robotic arm is modular and uses PVC piping as its structure. I have currently taken over the project, outside of MakeLab to bring this project to the world as an open source project. MakeLab is a great sponsor and a client to me now, and I really loved working with each and every one of my co-workers!</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">At Wilco Machine and Mold, I was responsible for PLC programming and high precision part machining. Before Wilco Machine and Mold, I had a lot of machining and fabrication experience but I have never worked with CNC mill or CNC lathe. Since we had a whole shop with all the tools you can imagine, we designed and manufactured the parts we needed for food packaging machine. This experience has taught me to design parts with the ease of machining in mind. The parts that I designed in Solidworks was imported in to BobCAM and we were machining parts on the CNC mills and lathe, in a very short amount of time. Another part of my job was to program PLCs for food packaging machines and a Residential Temperature Control System. We retrofitted many food packaging machines and most of the work was redoing all the electronics, including the PLC programming. The Residential Temperature Control System was for our client who wanted to control and monitor the temperature for three units. I was in charge of this project, from start to installation.</p>

I was a software engineer Co-Op, so most of my time there consisted of bug fixes and feature implementations. We used Python as the main language and I got lots of great experience in proper software development and working in a sizable software engineering team. Polar was a start-up with a great structure and whenever I work on the software part of a project, I look back to the practices that was implemented in Polar to do the development efficiently and properly!</p>
